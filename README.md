# Bank Transaction Analysis
<p>
  This is a beginner project in Python and will not initially be user friendly. The purpose of the program is to ingest a monthly bank transaction report in CSV format and provide a detailed breakdown of expenses:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add total cost of purchases by unique vendor (company and location specific).</li>
  <li>Sort transactions into categories using keywords.</li>
  <li>Add total savings transfers.</li>
  <li>Add total deposits</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is one of several low priority projects that will be utilized when convenient for study and practice.
